## Introduction

Open Policy Agent, often referred to as **OPA**, is a general-purpose, open-source policy engine that streamlines policy enforcement throughout the stack.

It was created by Styra and was later accepted by CNCF on March 29, 2018. Its maturity level is now labelled as **Graduated**.

By using OPA, we can define policy-as-code and remove the need for software to make policy decisions. Any tech stack, including Kubernetes, OpenTofu, CI/CD pipelines, etc., may utilize it to enforce policies.

High-level declarative policy language known as **Rego** is used to write OPA policy.
